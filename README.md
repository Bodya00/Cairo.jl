[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl)

Bindings to the Cairo graphics library.

Some of the functions implemented by this wrapper may be documented in [Base.Graphics](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/stdlib/graphics/).

There is an extensive set of [examples](samples/Samples.md).

On install, libraries will be compiled from source if not present.  [Diagnostics from BinDeps](https://github.com/JuliaLang/BinDeps.jl#diagnostics) may help avoid a lengthy compilation.
